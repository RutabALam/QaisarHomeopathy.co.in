<!-- Why Homeopathy? -->
<section class="why-homeopathy">
    <div class="overlay">
        <h2>Why Choose Homeopathy?</h2>
        <p>Homeopathy is a <strong>natural, holistic, and effective</strong> approach to healing, suitable for both <strong>chronic and acute conditions</strong>. It addresses a wide range of ailments, including <em>allergies, skin disorders, migraines, digestive issues, and common infections</em>. Unlike conventional medicine, homeopathy focuses on <strong>treating the root cause</strong> rather than just suppressing symptoms.</p>
    
        <p>With its <strong>safe, non-toxic, and side-effect-free</strong> remedies, homeopathy is suitable for people of all ages, including infants, pregnant women, and the elderly. It is also <strong>cost-effective and environmentally sustainable</strong>, making it a responsible choice in modern healthcare. More than just a treatment, homeopathy is a <strong>philosophy of healing</strong>â€”one that works in harmony with the body's natural intelligence and fosters lasting wellness.</p>
    
        <p>At <strong>Qaisar Homeopathic Clinic</strong>, we embrace this time-tested wisdom, providing <strong>compassionate, personalized care</strong> to help individuals regain their vitality and well-being.</p>
