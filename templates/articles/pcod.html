<h2>Understanding PCOD</h2>
<p>Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) is a common hormonal disorder that affects millions of women worldwide. It occurs when the ovaries produce an excessive number of immature eggs, leading to cyst formation and hormonal imbalances.</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <strong>Common Symptoms of PCOD:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Irregular or absent menstrual cycles</li>
        <li>Unwanted hair growth on face and body</li>
        <li>Weight gain and difficulty losing weight</li>
        <li>Acne, oily skin, and hair thinning</li>
        <li>Mood swings, anxiety, and depression</li>
        <li>Difficulty conceiving (infertility)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>How Homeopathy Helps in PCOD Treatment</h2>

</ul>
