    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        Islam, since its very inception, has emphasized the importance of knowledge and intellectual pursuit. The first revelation to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was <strong>“Read! In the name of your Lord who created”</strong> (Quran 96:1), a clear command to seek and spread knowledge.  
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        Science and Islam are not in conflict; rather, they complement each other. Many scientific principles, from **astronomy to medicine**, were discussed in the Quran long before modern science discovered them. This article explores the **harmony between Islam and science**, with a special focus on **Homeopathy** as a natural healing system in alignment with Islamic principles.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 26px; color: #16a085; margin-top: 20px;">The Quran and Scientific Discoveries</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        The Quran, revealed over 1400 years ago, contains numerous scientific facts that were only discovered in the last few centuries. Some of these include:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px; font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
        <li><strong>Big Bang Theory:</strong> The Quran mentions that the universe was a single entity before it was split apart (Quran 21:30), which aligns with the modern **Big Bang Theory**.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion of the Universe:</strong> The Quran states, <em>“And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander.”</em> (Quran 51:47), confirming the discovery that the universe is continuously expanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Embryology:</strong> The Quran describes the stages of human development in the womb in great detail (Quran 23:12-14), aligning with modern embryology.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Cycle:</strong> The Quran speaks about the process of evaporation, cloud formation, and rainfall (Quran 39:21), a concept that meteorologists confirmed centuries later.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size: 26px; color: #16a085; margin-top: 20px;">Islamic Medicine and the Role of Homeopathy</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        Islam has always encouraged medical advancements while maintaining a balance with natural healing. The **Prophetic traditions (Tibb al-Nabawi)** emphasize the importance of **herbal medicine, honey, black seed, and holistic healing**. This aligns perfectly with **Homeopathy**, a system of medicine that works with the body’s own healing mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; color: #2980b9; margin-top: 20px;">Why Homeopathy Aligns with Islamic Principles</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        Homeopathy is a **gentle, natural, and holistic** medical system that works in **harmony with the body**, rather than suppressing symptoms. Here’s why it aligns with **Islamic values**:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px; font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
        <li><strong>Natural Healing:</strong> Homeopathy uses <em>natural substances</em> like plants and minerals, avoiding synthetic chemicals.</li>
        <li><strong>No Harm:</strong> The **Prophetic Hadith** says: <em>“Do not cause harm, nor reciprocate harm.”</em> (Sunan Ibn Majah) – Homeopathy follows this principle by offering **side-effect-free** treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Healing Beyond Physical Symptoms:</strong> Islam recognizes the importance of emotional and spiritual well-being, which Homeopathy also addresses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size: 26px; color: #16a085; margin-top: 20px;">Contributions of Muslim Scientists to Science</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        Muslim scholars played a **pivotal role** in the development of science and medicine. Some great contributions include:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px; font-size: 18px; color: #444;">
        <li><strong>Al-Razi (Rhazes):</strong> A Persian physician who wrote the famous **Kitab al-Hawi (Comprehensive Book of Medicine)**.</li>
        <li><strong>Ibn Sina (Avicenna):</strong> His book <em>“The Canon of Medicine”</em> was a standard medical text in Europe for centuries.</li>
        <li><strong>Al-Khwarizmi:</strong> The father of **Algebra**, whose contributions shaped modern mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>Alhazen:</strong> A pioneer of **optics and vision science**, laying the foundation for modern physics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size: 26px; color: #16a085; margin-top: 20px;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        Islam and science are not separate; they are deeply connected. The Quran encourages **seeking knowledge**, and history proves that **Islamic scholars have significantly contributed** to scientific progress.  
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444; line-height: 1.8;">
        Homeopathy, as a **holistic and natural healing** approach, fits seamlessly into the **Islamic framework** of medicine. It emphasizes **gentle healing, natural balance, and prevention**, which resonate with Islamic teachings.
