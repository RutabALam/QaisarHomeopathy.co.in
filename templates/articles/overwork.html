    <h1>The Tragic Comedy of Overworking</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to the Hustle—A 24/7 Tragedy</h2>
    <p>We live in an age where <span class="highlight">burnout is a badge of honor</span>, and exhaustion is seen as a sign of dedication. But let’s be honest—<span class="highlight">is this "grind" actually worth it?</span></p>

    <h2>The Physical Toll: Your Body is Keeping Score</h2>

    <h3>1. Sleep Deprivation: The Silent Killer</h3>
    <p>Your body needs rest. Chronic sleep deprivation leads to <span class="highlight">heart disease, weak immunity, and brain fog.</span> But hey, who needs sleep when you have coffee, right?</p>

    <h3>2. “Workaholic Diet”: Junk & Caffeine</h3>
    <p>Skipping meals and living on caffeine? <span class="highlight">Your organs are filing a complaint.</span> Poor nutrition leads to sluggishness and health problems. But who has time to eat when deadlines are screaming?</p>

    <h3>3. Chronic Pain: Your Spine is Begging You to Stop</h3>
    <p>Long hours at your desk, hunched over a screen? <span class="highlight">Your back and neck hate you.</span> But sure, your expensive ergonomic chair fixes everything… (it doesn’t).</p>

    <div class="important-box">
        <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> Your body is not a machine. Ignore it, and it will eventually force you to stop—on its own terms.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Mental Toll: Your Brain is Plotting Revenge</h2>

    <h3>1. Burnout: The Fancy Word for “Completely Done”</h3>
    <p>Burnout is when your brain rage-quits. No motivation, no focus, just <span class="highlight">pure exhaustion.</span> Sound familiar?</p>

    <h3>2. Anxiety & Stress: The Unpaid Interns in Your Mind</h3>
    <p>Deadlines, notifications, constant pressure—your stress levels are through the roof. <span class="highlight">Welcome to 24/7 anxiety.</span> But hey, deep breaths fix everything, right? (Wrong.)</p>

    <h2>The Social Fallout: Your Personal Life is a Ghost Town</h2>

    <h3>1. Friendships? Never Heard of Them.</h3>
    <p>Your friends stopped inviting you out. Why? Because <span class="highlight">they assume you’ll cancel.</span> Oops.</p>

    <h3>2. Your Family Thinks You Vanished</h3>
    <p>Work over relationships? <span class="highlight">Terrible decision.</span> Neglecting family will cost you more than a missed deadline ever will.</p>

    <div class="important-box">
        <p><strong>Harsh Truth:</strong> Your job will replace you in a week. Your family and friends? Not so much.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Biggest Lie: “Busy” Equals Productive</h2>
    <p>Overworking does not equal success. Studies show that <span class="highlight">productivity drops after 50 hours per week.</span> So why are we doing this to ourselves?</p>

    <h2 class="conclusion">Final Thought: Go Take a Nap. No, Seriously.</h2>
</div>
